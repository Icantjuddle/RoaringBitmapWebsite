<h1>Roaring bitmaps</h1>
<h2>A better compressed bitset</h2>

<p>
Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps.</p>

<p>Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise. In some instances, they can be hundreds of times faster and they often offer significantly better compression.</p>

<p>Roaring bitmaps are used by several important systems: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/">Apache Lucene</a> and derivative systems such as Solr and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a>,</li>
<li> Metamarkets' <a href="http://druid.io/">Druid</a>,</li>
<li> <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>,</li>
<li> <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh/">Whoosh</a>,</li>
<li> eBay's <a href="http://kylin.io">Apache Kylin</a>. </li>
</ul>


<h2>When should you use a bitmap?</h2>


<p>Sets are a fundamental abstraction in
software. They can be implemented in various
ways, as hash sets, as trees, and so forth.
In databases and search engines, sets are often an integral
part of indexes. For example, we may need to maintain a set
of all documents or rows  (represented by numerical identifier)
that satisfy some property. Besides adding or removing
elements from the set, we need fast functions
to compute the intersection, the union, the difference between sets, and so on.
</p>

<p>To implement a set
of integers, a particularly appealing strategy is the
bitmap (also called bitset or bit vector). Using n bits,
we can represent any set made of the integers from the range
[0,n): it suffices to set the ith bit is set to one if integer i is present in the set.
Commodity processors use words of W=32 or W=64 bits. By combining many such words, we can
support large values of n. Intersections, unions and differences can then be implemented
 as bitwise AND, OR and ANDNOT operations.
More complicated set functions can also be implemented as bitwise operations.</p>

<p>When the bitset approach is applicable, it can be orders of
magnitude faster than other possible implementation of a set (e.g., as a hash set)
while using several times less memory.</p>


<h2>When should you use compressed bitmaps?</h2>

<p>An uncompress BitSet can use a lot of memory. For example, if you take a BitSet
and set the bit at position 1,000,000 to true and you have just over 100kB. That's over 100kB
to store the position of one bit. This is wasteful  even if you do not care about memory:
suppose that you need to compute the intersection between this BitSet and another one
that has a bit at position 1,000,001 to true, then you need to go through all these zeroes,
whether you like it or not. That can become very wasteful.</p>

<p>This being said, there are definitively cases where attempting to use compressed bitmaps is wasteful.
For example, if you have a small universe size. E.g., your bitmaps represent sets of integers
from [0,n) where n is small (e.g., n=64 or n=128). If you are able to uncompressed BitSet and
it does not blow up your memory usage,  then compressed bitmaps are probably not useful
to you. In fact, if you do not need compression, then a BitSet offers remarkable speed.</p>


<h2>How does Roaring compares with the alternatives?</h2>


<p>Most alternatives to Roaring are part of a larger family of compressed bitmaps that are run-length-encoded
bitmaps. They identify long runs of 1s or 0s and they represent them with a marker word.
If you have a local mix of 1s and 0, you use an uncompressed word.</p>

<p>There are many formats in this family:</p>
<ul>
<li> Oracle's BBC is an obsolete format at this point: though it may provide good compression,
it is likely much slower than more recent alternatives due to excessive branching.</li>
<li> WAH is a patented variation on BBC that provides better performance.</li>
<li> Concise is a variation on the patented WAH. It some specific instances, it can compress
much better than WAH (up to 2x better), but it is generally slower.</li>
<li> EWAH is both free of patent, and it is faster than all the above. On the downside, it
does not compress quite as well. It is faster because it allows some form of "skipping"
over uncompressed words. So though none of these formats are great at random access, EWAH
is better than the alternatives.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a big problem with these formats however that can hurt you badly in some cases: there is no random access. If you want to check whether a given value is present in the set, you have to start from the beginning and "uncompress" the whole thing. This means that if you want to intersect a big set with a large set, you still have to uncompress the whole big set in the worst case...</p>

<p>Roaring solves this problem. It works in the following manner. It divides the data into chunks of 2<sup>16</sup> integers
(e.g., [0, 2<sup>16</sup>), [2<sup>16</sup>, 2 x 2<sup>16</sup>), ...). Within a chunk, it can use an uncompressed bitmap, a simple list of integers,
or a list of runs. Whatever format it uses, they all allow you to check for the present of any one value quickly
(e.g., with a binary search). The net result is that Roaring can compute many operations much faster that run-length-encoded
formats like WAH, EWAH, Concise... Maybe surprisingly, Roaring also generally offers better compression ratios.</p>
